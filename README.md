# Data-Preprocessing
objective:
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a robust datapreprocessing system that addresses common challenges such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. By performing effective data preprocessing,the project aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for machine learning

By using the employee dataset  for data cleaning and preprocessing, and perform these steps 

Data Exploration: 
                Explore the data, find the unique values ,datatypes,duplicate rows, in each feature .Perform the statistical analysis and renaming of the columns.

Data Cleaning: 
                Find the missing and inappropriate values, treat them appropriately. Remove all duplicate rows. Find the outliers.
                Replace the value 0 in age as NaN and also treat the null values in all columns using any measures(removing/ replace thevalues with mean/median/mode)

Data Analysis:
                 Filter the data with some criterio such as age, salary,place.Plot the  different types of chart  with age ,salary,Placerepresent it visually

Data Encoding:
                Here,Use the One hot encoding and Label encodin for converting the dataset into numerical representation also split the dataset for dividing the target variable and predicted variable
                
Feature Scaling: 
                 Feature scaling is applied using standard scaler and minmax scaler on numerical predictor variables improved the performance.
